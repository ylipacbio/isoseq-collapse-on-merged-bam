There is a bug in SMRTLink 7.0 IsoSeq with Mapping workflow, which was 
- introduced by chunking transcripts bam file into multiple small files, 
- while IsoSeq collapsing is performed on each of the chunk (each small file),
thus,
- transcripts mapping to the same genomic location (which should be placed in the same group), may be put into different gene groups. 

Please wait for official bug fix bug in SMRTLink 8.0 release!

Note this is not official bug fix, nor official patch.
No guarantee, no libility, try at your own risk.

here is a solution for Advanced Users who is willing to take a risk.

Prerequisite:
  You have access to SMRTLink 7.0 build for command line tools such as
  `dataset`, `python -m isocollapse.tasks.collapse_mapped_isoforms`, `samtools`

Steps:
1. Download `isocollapse-on-merged-bam.sh` and `reset-transcriptalignmentset.py`
```
wget
```
2. identify job root of SMRTLink IsoSeq with Mapping job, ${job_root}, and 
3. then call 
   bash isocollapse-on-merged-bam.sh  ${job_root}
e.g., if SMRTLink IsoSeq job path is: /mymount/myjob/001/0012345, run
   bash isocollapse-on-merged-bam.sh  /mymount/myjob/001/0012345
   You will see regenerated output files out.gff, out.fastq etc
